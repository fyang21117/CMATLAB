# CMATLAB
In this demo, MATLAB engine is called by C language to complete instruction transmission, data reading and writing, etc., 
with the following main functions:
Matlab environment to write test data.
Matlab environment to send commands, called the algorithm processing data (the algorithm vsdemoc.m file in the Matlab path);
Process reads the results from the Matlab environment and returns return_num and level.
And the main files are VSdemoc.c and VSdemoc.m,others are essential.
My experimental environment for Windows is win7_x64,Microsoft Visual Studio 2017_x64,and MATLAB_2016b_x64;
and for Linux is Centos7.5,gcc_7.1.0,and MATLAB_2016b_x64.
I have passed the two environment tests and realized the direct communication between c language and MATLAB.
Your comments and suggestions are appreciated!And write to me by yf21117@gmail.com.
